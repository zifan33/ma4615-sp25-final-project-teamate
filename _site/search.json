In the previous correlation-based analysis, the discrimination gap may have been misspecified due to omitted variable bias (OVB). For instance, instead of taste-based discrimination, labor market outcome inequality may be driven by different levels of educational attainment, work experience, or other factors that are not controlled for.\nThis analysis leverages the powerful experimental data and codes from the Rose et al. (2022) paper to estimate the causal impact of being Black on the probability of receiving a callback.\nThe analysis is based on the following research questions:\n\nDoes tasted-based discrimination cause differential labor market outcomes in the U.S?\n\n\nIf so, how large is the magnitude?\n\n\nIs there evidence of intersectional heterogeneity—that is, does the magnitude of the Black callback penalty vary by another trait?\n\n\n\nIf so, how large is the magnitude?\n\n\nDo firm‑ or month‑level shocks attenuate or amplify measured discrimination?"

In the simplest linear probability model (column 1), being Black reduces the probability of any callback by about 2.1 percentage points (SE=0.3pp). When we add firm and month fixed effects (column 2), the gap narrows only slightly to 2.0 pp, indicating that sorting of Black resumes into “easier” or “tougher” firms/months accounts for very little of the raw disparity. In the balanced‐sample OLS (column 5), the Black penalty is essentially unchanged at 2.2 pp. The corresponding logistic regressions (columns 3 and 6) imply a roughly 11–12 percent reduction in the odds of callback for Black applicants, again robust to fixed effects and sample restrictions.\nAmong the other resume traits, Over 40 exhibits a modest negative effect in the unrestricted sample (–0.6 pp) but loses significance in the balanced sample. Gender itself (Female) has no discernible callback penalty or bonus. Signals like political, academic, or LGBTQ club affiliations never reach conventional significance, nor does holding an associate degree. Interestingly, the use of same‑gender pronouns on the résumé is associated with a small but borderline significant callback penalty in the basic models (–1.4 pp), and the neutral‑pronoun penalty becomes significant in the balanced OLS (–1.7 pp). This hints that nontraditional pronoun signaling may carry a slight cost in this context, though the effect sizes are small relative to the race gap.\nThe model fit remains modest: R² climbs from just 2.4 percent without fixed effects to about 15 percent once we absorb firm‐and‐month variation, underscoring that much of the callback decision is driven by idiosyncratic job‐level factors and unobserved employer preferences. All standard errors are clustered at the job level, and the F‑statistics confirm the joint significance of the regressors.\nKey takeaway : Even after controlling for a broad vector of resume characteristics and accounting for firm/month heterogeneity, Black applicants face a persistent 2pp lower callback rate—roughly a 12 percent relative penalty—highlighting taste‑based discrimination in large‑firm hiring.\n\n\nVisualization of OLS Estimates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can observe that the coefficient estimates for the Black variable are negative and significant across all samples since the 95% confidence intervals do not include 0. Also, gender-neutral pronoun estimates are significant in the balanced sample."

In other words, Black applicants who include gender‑neutral pronouns on their résumé face an additional callback penalty."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis analysis leverages a large-scale résumé audit experiment to estimate the causal effect of race on callback rates at Fortune 500 firms. Across all linear probability and logit specifications—both unrestricted and balanced samples—being Black reduces the probability of any form of contact by roughly 2 percentage points (≈ 11–12 percent relative penalty), a gap that remains unchanged once we absorb firm and month fixed effects.\nPronoun usage carries a small penalty, and in the balanced sample the Black × Gender‑Neutral Pronouns and Black × Female interaction are also significant, indicating an extra penalty for Black applicants who signal intersecionality.\n\n\nLimitations\n\nExternal validity: Firms in the Fortune 500 may not reflect smaller or mid‑sized employers’ behavior. The generalizability of these results to other sectors or regions is uncertain. Future work could extend this analysis to a broader set of firms, including smaller employers or those in different industries.\nAdditional outcome: Social capital and social networks are important in the hiring process. Future work could explore how race affect social capital accumulation and its impact on hiring outcomes. For example, do Black applicants have fewer connections to employees at the firms they apply to? Do they receive fewer referrals or recommendations from friends or family members?\n\nA new study using LinkedIn: LinkedOut? A Field Experiment on Discrimination in Job Network Formation\n\nMore racial variation: Since this study only covers black-white differences, it would be interesting to see how other racial groups are affected. For example, do Asian applicants face similar or different discrimination patterns compared to Black applicants? Do Hispanic applicants experience different callback rates based on their names or other characteristics?"

This dataset, published alongside the article by Kline, Rose, and Walters (2022), examines potential systemic hiring discrimination by large U.S. employers. The data primarily cover hiring outcomes, employer characteristics, and applicant demographic details spanning several years. Data is originally collected by authors. They conducted a randomized control trail (RCT) to identify patterns of potential discrimination, estimating the magnitude of these effects, and understanding whether certain employer or regional characteristics are associated with differential outcomes.\nData #2: URL: https://opportunityinsights.org/data/\nThe dataset described in College-Level Data for 139 Selective American Colleges provides insights into college application and attendance patterns among U.S. students based on parental income. Compiled by linking standardized test-takers (SAT or ACT from 2011, 2013, or 2015) to tax data, this dataset categorizes students into income bins to analyze disparities in college access. It covers 139 selective colleges, including Ivy-Plus institutions, elite private colleges, and flagship public universities. The dataset includes key metrics such as relative application rates, attendance rates, and conditional attendance rates, allowing researchers to examine how income influences higher education opportunities.\nA challenge in working with this dataset is its reliance on estimated values, as noise has been added for privacy reasons, potentially affecting precision. Additionally, while the dataset is rich in application and attendance statistics, it does not include direct measures of student academic performance beyond standardized test scores, limiting deeper analysis of post-admission outcomes.\nData #3 URL: https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/teds-treatment-episode-data-set/datafiles The Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS), available through the SAMHSA website (TEDS Data Files), provides comprehensive data on individuals entering substance abuse treatment programs across the U.S. It includes over 2 million treatment episodes, with rows representing individual treatment episodes and columns covering demographics, substance use types, treatment modalities, and outcomes. The data is collected through state-administered systems in federally-funded treatment centers, aiming to monitor patterns of substance use, treatment needs, and outcomes. This standardized collection allows for detailed analysis of treatment trends across different regions and populations.\nWhile the dataset is available in multiple formats such as SAS, SPSS, and ASCII, loading and cleaning the data may require addressing missing values, ensuring proper data type conversion, and standardizing categories. A few key questions that can be explored include how treatment outcomes vary by demographics and how substance abuse trends differ across states and over time. Challenges may include the large size of the dataset, handling missing data, and ensuring confidentiality with sensitive information."

Key aspects of the study include:\n\nObjective: To detect whether disparate treatment in hiring—particularly based on race, gender, and age—is concentrated within specific companies.\nDesign: A targeted randomized control trial where fictitious applications (varying by race, gender, and other resume characteristics) were submitted to over 100 Fortune 500 firms across multiple waves (including during the COVID pandemic).\nScale: Over 84,000 applications were sent, enabling both firm-level and industry-level analysis of callback rates.\nContext: The data is used to measure systemic discrimination, a term defined by patterns or practices with a broad impact on an industry or geographic area, and to provide actionable intelligence for policy enforcement (e.g., EEOC investigations).\n\nThis background provides important context on both the experimental design and the intended use of the data, highlighting potential challenges such as sample bias and variability across firms.\nIn this post, I describe the initial steps for loading and cleaning the dataset. I begin by reading in the cleaned data from an RDS file. The dataset contains various variables, including age_at_sub, month, year, and state, which I will explore to understand data quality and identify potential issues.

By analyzing fictitious job applications in a randomized correspondence experiment, we can both verify and quantify these disparities."

    "text": "Check distribution of population by state\nThe following code organizes data from the U.S. Census Bureau and creates a bar plot that orders states by their population in 2024. This visualization highlights the distribution of population density across states, providing a clear comparison to the research data. By aligning the population data with the research findings, the plot demonstrates a correlation between states with higher populations and the number of samples collected in those states.\n\ncolnames(census_data)[1] &lt;- \"states\"\n\ncensus_data &lt;- census_data %&gt;% \n  select(-2) %&gt;% \n  slice(-(1:3))\n\ncolnames(census_data)[2:6] &lt;- c(\"2020\", \"2021\", \"2022\", \"2023\", \"2024\")\n\ncensus_data &lt;- census_data %&gt;% filter(grepl(\"^\\\\.\", states))\n\ncensus_data &lt;- census_data %&gt;% \n  filter(states != \".Puerto Rico\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(states = gsub(\"^\\\\.\", \"\", states)) \n\ncensus_data %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(y = reorder(states, `2024`), x = `2024`)) +  # Use backticks for column names\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Population Distribution by State (2024)\",\n    y = \"State\",\n    x = \"Population\"\n  )"
